          <h1>Welcome to your app!</h1>
          <p>
            This is a basic template to get your dapp started with the Stellar
            Design System and Soroban contracts. You can customize it further by
            adding your own contracts, components, and styles.
          </p>
          <h2>Developing your contracts</h2>
          <p>
            Your contracts are located in the contracts/ directory, and you can
            modify them to suit your needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you update them, the{" "}
            <Code size="md">stellar scaffold watch</Code> command will
            automatically recompile them and update the dapp with the latest
            changes.
          </p>
          <h2>Interacting with contracts from the frontend</h2>
          Scaffold stellar automatically builds your contract packages, and you
          can import them in your frontend code like this:
          <pre>
            <Code size="md">{`import soroban_hello_world_contract from "./contracts/soroban_hello_world_contract.ts";`}</Code>
          </pre>
          <p>And then you can call the contract methods like this:</p>
          <pre>
            <Code size="md">{`const statusMessage = await soroban_hello_world_contract.hello({"to": "world"});`}</Code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            By doing this, you can use the contract methods in your components.
            If your contract emits events, check out the{" "}
            <Code size="md">useSubscription</Code> hook in the hooks/ folder to
            listen to them.
          </p>
          <h2>Interacting with wallets</h2>
          <p>
            This project is already integrated with Stellar Wallet Kit, and the{" "}
            {`useWallet`} hook is available for you to use in your components.
            You can use it to connect to get connected account information.
          </p>
          <h2>Deploying your app</h2>
          <p>
            To deploy your contracts, use the{" "}
            <Code size="md">stellar contract deploy</Code> command (
            <a href="https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/guides/cli/install-deploy">
              docs
            </a>
            ) to deploy to the appropriate Stellar network.
          </p>
          <p>
            Build your frontend application code with{" "}
            <Code size="md">npm run build</Code> and deploying the output in the{" "}
            <Code size="md">dist/</Code> directory.
